# Cuidoteca - Childcare Management System

## Overview

Cuidoteca is a full-stack web application for managing childcare services, built with React (frontend) and Express.js (backend). The system facilitates childcare scheduling, community interaction, and administrative tasks for parents, caregivers, and coordinators.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for authentication
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with role-based access control

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

## Key Components

### User Management
- **User Roles**: Three distinct roles (parent, institution, cuidador)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role verification
- **Profile Management**: Complete user profile with university details
- **Cuidador System**: Separate enrollment system for caregivers to self-register

### Child Management
- **Child Registration**: Parents can register children with special needs information
- **Age Tracking**: Age-based categorization for appropriate care
- **Parent Association**: Children linked to parent accounts

### Scheduling System
- **Weekly Scheduling**: Monday to Friday scheduling with morning/afternoon/full-day periods

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email/password and profile information (parent, institution, or cuidador)
2. System hashes password and creates JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage for subsequent requests
4. Protected routes verify token and user role

### Cuidador Enrollment Flow
1. Cuidador registers and connects to institution
2. Cuidador browses available cuidotecas at institution
3. Cuidador self-enrolls without child selection
4. Institution reviews and approves/rejects cuidador enrollment
5. System updates enrollment status and notifies cuidador

### Scheduling Flow
1. Parent creates child profile
2. Parent submits schedule request with day/period preferences
3. Coordinator reviews and approves/rejects requests
4. System updates schedule status and notifies involved parties

### Community Interaction
1. Users create posts with text content
2. Posts displayed in chronological order
3. Other users can like posts
4. Like counts updated in real-time
